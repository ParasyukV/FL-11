                    Of course, travelling by air is the fastest and the most convenient way, but it is the most
                    expensive
                    too. Travelling by train is slower than by plane, but it has its advantages. You can see much more
                    interesting places of the country you are travelling through
                </p>
                <p class="main_uptext_left">Travelling by sea is very popular. Large ships and small river boats can
                    visit foreign countries

                <p>Every year my friend and I go somewhere to the South for holidays. The Black Sea is one of the most
                    wonderful places which attracts holiday-makers all over the world. There are many rest-homes,
                    sanatoriums and tourist camps there. But it is also possible to rent a room or a furnished house for
                    a couple of weeks there. </p>
